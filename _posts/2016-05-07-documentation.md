# Installation
Fork the ``master`` branch and create a ``gh-pages`` branch. This process will host this theme as a **Project Page**. You can also download the files for local development. Default theme will look like this

{% highlight yaml %}
.
.
#color scheme
sidebar-color: '#3A539B'       
accent-color: '#3A539B'

.
{% endhighlight %}
